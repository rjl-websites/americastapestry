                With conservatory training in visual and theatrical arts, Stefan
                oversees the design of each state embroidery panel. Fascinated with
                the intersection between archival inquiry and sartorial
                significance, Stefan is committed to telling stories that can only
                be told through textile-based sources. His costume design work has
                been seen on stage and film. As a Fulbright Scholar at the
                University of Glasgow, Stefan studied Dress and Textiles where he
                assisted on an exhibition in the Borders Region of Scotland,
                traveled to London to work on a period film set, and examined
                diaries at the archives of the University of Georgia. Stefan is
                excited to see where his work takes him next.
