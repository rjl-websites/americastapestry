The state design features the many roles New Jersey women undertook during the Revolution, including raising a phenomenal $15,000 for the patriot cause. Our historical advisor, [Passaic County Department of Cultural and Historical Affairs](/team/historical-partners/#dcha), conducted a significant amount of research on the fascinating lives of those living in the Dey Mansion in Passaic County. Famously, the Dey Family hosted Generals Lafayette and Washington at the Mansion in 1780.

Our New Jersey Directors are [Carol Prevost](/team/state-directors/#carol-prevost) and Kiki Lar. The stitching will be conducted by members of the [Colonial West EGA Chapter](/team/stitchers/#colonial-west) in partnership with the [Princeton EGA Chapter](/team/stitchers/#princeton). With their combined artistry and exceptional skill, we cannot wait to see this come together! They are stitching at St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Lumberton.
