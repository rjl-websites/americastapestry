The Georgia Panel depicts the **Chasseurs Volontaires de Saint-Domingue**, the Creole militia unit that participated in the Battle of Savannah in 1779. The unit was made up of both enslaved and free blacks from Saint-Domingue who fought either for income or for their freedom. The Battle of Savannah was one of the most diverse battles of the Revolution, featuring French, Creole, Native American, English, Scottish, and Colonial forces. This panel was designed in collaboration with the Coastal Heritage Society of Savannah.

The Georgia Panel will be stitched at the Atlanta History Center, a premier museum and research center of the South. The Museum holds one of the largest archives of Civil War artifacts in the U.S. Stitchers will work in the museum's state-of-the-art rotunda, allowing all visitors to engage with both the panel's history as well as the stitchers to learn about their organization.

Our Georgia Director is Deborah Berger, President of the EGA Dogwood Chapter and EGA National Director of Education. Deborah is mobilizing stitchers from all needlework organizations in the greater Atlanta area to work on the project.
