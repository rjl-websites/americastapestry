Apatu, presently residing in Baltimore, Maryland, is an illustrator and fine artist. She attended Towson University in Towson, Maryland for summer intensive training, and is currently pursuing her Bachelors of Fine Art degree in General Fine Arts and a minor in Illustration at Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) .Â 

Apatu's practice is based in realism and surrealism with themes of cognitive thinking, spiritual connections and naturalism. Utilizing dry media, mostly graphite and charcoal pencils, she creates semi-realistic portraiture on stretched paper over wooden panels. She has exhibited her work at public museums such as the Banneker-Douglass Museum, Gallery 57 West, and the Art Farm located in Annapolis, MD. Abena Apatu will be exhibiting her recent body of work at MICA's Artwalk in Spring 2025. She plans to pursue a Master's degree in Art Therapy.
