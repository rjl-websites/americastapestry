The The Embroiderers’ Guild of America (EGA) was selected as a collaborator due to their dedication to the art of embroidery and their commitment to community engagement. Their mission aligns with our project's goal of celebrating American history through textile arts of the highest quality. The EGA plays a central role in both the creation and the educational outreach of the project. Members are involved in designing the layout and stitching the panels, ensuring that each piece reflects historically accurate embroidery techniques as well as artistic excellence. Additionally, the EGA helps organize and facilitate workshops, allowing participants to learn about and contribute to the tapestry. Their expertise ensures that America's Tapestry not only commemorates our nation's history but also engages and educates the public on traditional folk art practices.
