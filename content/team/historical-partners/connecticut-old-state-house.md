The Connecticut Old State House was chosen as a collaborator due to its significant historical relevance and expertise in the preservation and interpretation of Connecticut’s rich political and cultural history. This landmark is not only a repository of the state's heritage but also actively engages in educating the public about Connecticut’s role in the broader narrative of American history, making it an ideal partner for a project that aims to weave historical insights into artistic expression. The Connecticut Old State House will provide crucial historical expertise and archival resources to ensure the authenticity and accuracy of the Connecticut Tapestry Panel. Additionally, the Old State House will host workshops and a public exhibition of the Tapestry, leveraging its central location and visitor traffic to engage a broad audience.
