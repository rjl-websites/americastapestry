The Fraunces Tavern Museum was chosen as a collaborator due to its unique historical significance and dedicated focus on the American Revolutionary era. Located in one of New York City's oldest buildings, where George Washington bid farewell to his officers in 1783, the museum is deeply embedded in the fabric of American history. It houses a rich collection of 18th-century art, artifacts, and manuscripts, providing invaluable resources for research and exhibition. The museum's staff includes historians and educators who specialize in this era, equipped with the expertise necessary to interpret and present complex historical themes engagingly and accurately.

The Museum plays a crucial role in the project by providing specialized knowledge and historical insights for the New York Tapestry. The museum will host workshops and exhibitions related to _America's Tapestry_, leveraging its prominent location to attract and educate a diverse audience.
