Passaic County Department of Historic and Cultural Affairs (DCHA) plays a critical role in community engagement and historical consultation for the New Jersey panel as well as serve as an exhibition venue for the completed Tapestry. DCHA is responsible for county-based historical preservation projects and operates historical sites, including museums and archives that hold artifacts and documents from the Revolutionary War period. Their ongoing work in promoting local history through educational programs and public events equips them with a deep understanding of the area's historical and cultural dynamics. The department's extensive network within the local community and its experience in managing cultural projects make it an ideal collaborator. By leveraging DCHAâ€™s resources and expertise, America's Tapestry benefits from a grounded, locally-informed perspective that honors the specific historical contributions of New Jersey, enhancing the overall richness and educational value of the project.
