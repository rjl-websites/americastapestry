William & Mary was chosen to collaborate due to its distinguished heritage, academic rigor, and commitment to historical and cultural education. The institution's deep-rooted historical context provides a well-informed perspective crucial to the development of the Virginia panel. The university houses the [Muscarelle Museum of Art](https://muscarelle.wm.edu/), a premiere visual arts museum set to open a generational expansion of over 42,000 sq. ft., and the [Omohundro Institute of Early American History & Culture](https://oieahc.wm.edu/), renowned for its comprehensive research and publications related to vast early American history. William & Mary’s commitment to diversity and inclusion aligns with the project’s goal to highlight the contributions of historically marginalized groups. The university will debut the Tapestry at the Muscarelle in June 2026, complementing William & Mary’s Semiquincentennial programming alongside that of Colonial Williamsburg.
