With their extensive state archives and records of local history, the Coastal Heritage Society (CHS) is ideally suited to guide the representation of Georgia's unique contributions to the Revolution. Founded in 1975 in Savannah, Georgia, the CHS has a longstanding commitment to preserving the cultural and architectural heritage of the coastal Southeast region. This non-profit organization manages several historically significant sites and museums in Savannah, including the Savannah History Museum, the Georgia State Railroad Museum, and Old Fort Jackson, among others.
