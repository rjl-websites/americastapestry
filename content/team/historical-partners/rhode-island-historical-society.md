The Rhode Island Historical Society was selected to collaborate due to its extensive expertise and commitment to preserving and interpreting Rhode Island's rich history. This organization is pivotal for its deep archival resources and active engagement in promoting Rhode Island's historical narratives, which makes it an essential partner for a project focused on weaving the stateâ€™s diverse historical threads into a comprehensive artistic depiction. They provide crucial archival materials and scholarly insights, drawing from their extensive collections that encompass a range of artifacts, documents, and artworks from the colonial period through the Revolutionary War. Additionally, the Society plays an active role in community outreach and engagement, organizing educational programs and exhibitions related to the tapestry project at their facilities, which include the John Brown House Museum and the Museum of Work & Culture.
