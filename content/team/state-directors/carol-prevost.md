Carol Prevost is the co-leader for New Jersey Tapestry Panel. She learned to embroider at an early age and vividly remembers her Scottish great-grandmother showing her how to make tidier French knots, at age 10 or 11.

She first visited the Bayeux tapestry in 1976 and completed a reproduction of the fourth panel with original stitch and similar wool dyes in the early eighties. This remains one of her proudest accomplishments, due to its scope. During the 1990's, Carol inherited needlework supplies from another great-grandmother, of Norwegian descent, and subsequently became enamored with Hardanger embroidery, eventually making a Hardanger tablecloth, another long-term endeavor. Since then, she has explored other whitework techniques, such as Schwalm and Boutis and has experimented with goldwork, including a summer workshop at the Royal School of Needlework in Hampton Palace.

In addition to providing the means to create both useful and decorative pieces, for oneself or as gifts, Carol also believes in the power of needlework to fully relax the stitcher, due to the intense concentration and total immersion it entails. This seldom-mentioned by-product of needlework is particularly relevant in our stressful environments nowadays.

Currently President of the Princeton EGA Chapter, Carol enjoyed visiting the [Great Tapestry of Scotland](https://www.greattapestryofscotland.com/) in 2024, and enjoys collaborating with the Colonial West Chapter in embroidering the New Jersey Panel for Americaâ€™s Tapestry.
