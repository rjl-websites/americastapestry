Catherine Theron has designed and taught counted thread pieces for over 30 years and has published designs under the name _Theron Traditions_. She was also co-founder of _The Gentle Art_ overdyed thread company. She has been a member of EGA for 40 years and has just finished serving two terms as President for her local chapter--Williamsburg Rose & Thistle.

Catherine has worked with needles and threads most of her life. She remembers the needlework resurgence that occurred after our countryâ€™s bicentennial and hopes that this tapestry project will spark another stitching revolution with people of all ages and backgrounds. Having the Virginia panel housed at the [Muscarelle Museum of Art](https://muscarelle.wm.edu/) on the beautiful campus of William & Mary will be a delight!

She enjoys stitching with all who have embroidery knowledge and expertise as well as teaching those who wish to participate.
