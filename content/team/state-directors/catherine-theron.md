Catherine Theron has designed and taught counted thread pieces for over 30 years and has published designs under the name _Theron Traditions_. She was also co-founder of _The Gentle Art_ overdyed thread company. She has been a member of EGA for 40 years & has just finished serving two terms as President for her local chapter- Williamsburg Rose & Thistle.

Catherine has worked with needles & threads most of her life. She remembers the needlework resurgence that occurred after our countryâ€™s bicentennial & hopes that this tapestry project will spark another stitching revolution with people of all ages & backgrounds. Having the Virginia panel housed at the Muscarelle Museum of Art on the beautiful campus of William & Mary will be a delight!

She looks forward to stitching with any & all who have stitching knowledge & expertise as well as teaching those who wish to participate.
