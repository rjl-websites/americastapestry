Laura Kasowitz is the owner of [Hartford Stitch](https://www.hartfordstitch.com/), a sewing, fiber, and textile art school in West Hartford, CT where she shares her love of sewing, needlework, and fiber crafts with children and adults.

She believes that handcrafts are not only practical and creative, but empowering. Knowledge of these crafts gives us an opportunity to connect with our own abilities, each other, and those who came before us. Alongside classes, she has organized community sewing events and intergenerational sewing programs.
