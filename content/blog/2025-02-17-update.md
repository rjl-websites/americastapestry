Dear All,

﻿Happy February! While we often feel need to hibernate this time of year, we at America’s Tapestry have shaken off those winter cobwebs, rolled our sleeves up, and burned the midnight oil!

## What’s New

﻿We have prepared our first panel for stitching. The design for the Georgia Panel has been carefully laid out on a piece of 55” x 65” linen ready for the hands of talented embroiderers.

The tracing of the design took about 8 hours and a very steady hand with the aid of a prodigious light box. We look forward to seeing the stitchers in action later this month at the [Atlanta History Center](https://qzwbpg.clicks.mlsend.com/tf/cl/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjEyNjQ1MzksXCJsXCI6MTQ2NTA2NzcxNDg4MzEwODIzLFwiclwiOjE0NjUwNjc4MjM3MjUyOTc3NH0iLCJzIjoiOWRhZTIzOTFmNTI0ZjBjMyJ9)!

A preliminary embroidery frame has been designed, featuring four 68” wooden boards that interlock to adjustable dimensions. If you think your state may benefit from this frame, please [get in touch](/contact).

## February Spotlight - New York

This month we are returning to our Spotlight Series to showcase the [New York Panel](/tapestries/new-york/). The design features the Birch Trials, one of the lesser known events hosted by New York’s iconic [Fraunces Tavern](https://qzwbpg.clicks.mlsend.com/tf/cl/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjEyNjQ1MzksXCJsXCI6MTQ2NTA2NzcxNTAwODkzNzM4LFwiclwiOjE0NjUwNjc4MjM3MjUyOTc3NH0iLCJzIjoiYTFlMGNmODgwMjI5NDM0OSJ9). Significant research undertaken by the Tavern (at which you can still enjoy a pint or two) has uncovered this important story that resulted in one of the largest emancipations of Black people prior to the Civil War. The Birch Trials were established to determine claims formerly enslaved individuals made about service to the British Crown during the American Revolution.

In 1783, American and British Generals gathered at Fraunces Tavern to hear and debate these cases, ultimately determining whether the petitioner would be sent to Nova Scotia as a reward for their service to King George III, or return to slavery in the United States if their case was unclear or contested.

Within the design, a hearing is underway in the upper left hand corner. A man advocates for his service and loyalty to Great Britain during the Revolution--a speech which will ultimately determine his fate.

﻿In the panel’s center, we learn about the various roles undertaken by enslaved people in the British Army--tradesmen, laborers, and soldiers in Dunmore’s famous Ethiopian Regiment.

﻿The lower right hand corner depicts a family en route to their new home in Nova Scotia as citizens of the British Crown.

The New York Panel is directed by [Jenni Paperman](https://qzwbpg.clicks.mlsend.com/tf/cl/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjEyNjQ1MzksXCJsXCI6MTQ2NTA2NzcxNTA0MDM5NDY3LFwiclwiOjE0NjUwNjc4MjM3MjUyOTc3NH0iLCJzIjoiNTg5NmU3N2Y0ZTZjNjQ1NCJ9) and will be stitched at the [Van Schaick Mansion](http://www.vanschaickmansion.org/) in Albany by the Capitol District Chapter of the EGA alongside other organizations. We are excited for them to get underway!
