Dear All,

That's right - it's December! I hope everyone's holiday spirit is in full swing and no matter where you are - stay warm!

## What's New

This month we had a wonderful meeting with David Brashear, director of the [Muscarelle Museum of Art](https://muscarelle.wm.edu/), who is thrilled to be hosting the debut exhibition of America's Tapestry. It will be one of their first exhibitions in their gorgeous new expansion scheduled to be completed in January 2025.

One of his main comments was the importance of this piece of art in conflicting times such as ours. He believes it will be a touching tribute to the Revolution and a legacy piece from our 250th anniversary. **Additionally, he asked if the panels could be completed by June 2026** so they could be installed and set to go for the July celebration. That means we have our work cut out for us!

We have been regularly meeting with our fiscal agent [Seton Hill University](https://www.setonhill.edu/), who we are collaborating with on two additional grant opportunities - [Heinz Endowment Grant](https://www.heinz.org/) & [America250PA Organization Grant](https://www.america250pa.org/HOME). We believe America's Tapestry strongly aligns with both organizations' missions and will no doubt be a competitive application.

## December Showcase - New Jersey

This month we are highlighting the state of New Jersey. The state design features the many roles New Jersey women undertook during the Revolution, including raising a phenomenal $15,000 for the patriot cause. Our historical advisor is the [Passaic County Department of Cultural and Historical Affairs](https://www.passaiccountynj.org/departments/cultural-and-historic-affairs), who conducted a significant amount of research on the fascinating lives of those living in the Dey Mansion in Passaic County. Famously, the Dey Family hosted Generals Lafayette and Washington at the Mansion in 1780.

The stitching will be conducted by members of the **Colonial West EGA Chapter** in partnership with the **Princeton EGA Chapter**. With their combined artistry and exceptional skill, we cannot wait to see this come together! They will be stitching at **St. Andrews Church in Hainesport**, approximately 20 miles east from Philadelphia.

Lastly, New Jersey is one of our exhibition venues - ** the 13 completed panels will gather for an exhibition at the arts center managed by Passaic County** from October 2026 to January 2027. Stay tuned for information regarding the reception ceremony! We would love to see many of you there.
