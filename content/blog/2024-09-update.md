Happy September! I hope you have enjoyed a restful and sun-filled summer.

With the changing season, we decided it was time to initiate a monthly newsletter to keep everyone 'in the loop'.

## What's New?

To say this has been a busy year is an understatement. Since January, America's Tapestry has launched its official website, amassed historical collaborators in 13 states, recruited stitchers in 9 of the 13 original colonies, and applied for grant funding. From a single idea to generating broad public support, we could not have asked for a more thrilling trajectory.

Organizations from [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/) in Virginia and to the [New Hampshire Historical Society](https://www.nhhistory.org/) in the 'Granite State' have volunteered their time and expertise to ensure America's Tapestry accurately depicts historical events and individuals. We are incredibly grateful for their support. Many of these institutions have offered to host stitchers as they work, providing a beautiful setting to embroider while engaging with the public!

This summer, we have applied for a **$100,000** Grant from the [National Endowment for the Arts](https://www.arts.gov/) to expand the project. With additional funding, we will be able to include virtual programming and in-person seminars while the Tapestry is in 'production' at various historical sites across the Eastern Seaboard.

Additionally, we plan to receive a **$20,000** grant from the [Coby Foundation](https://cobyfoundation.org/) to fund a travelling exhibition to Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts in 2026.

We are thrilled to announce **we have raised $20,000** for the cost of materials to construct the Tapestry. This support has come from community members across the states to ensure the project will come to fruition.

Lastly, I had the honor to speak at the [EGA National Seminar](https://egausa.org/event/ega-national-seminar-2024/) in Atlanta last month. The level of talent and enthusiasm for the art of needlework was deeply inspiring. This year's theme - 'Preserving Needle Art' - could not have more deeply resonated with our project's aims.

## Timeline & Logistics

Many of you have asked about a timeline for America's Tapestry. **We plan to stitch from July 2025 - June 2026**. This permits 11 months for the panels to be stitched. We will work with stitchers in each state to ensure each design can be completed within the time allotted.

**All materials will be distributed in June 2025**, along with the linen ground fabric which will have the design traced onto each panel.

## What's Next?

Fall will be another busy season! We are in conversation with our partners on the design of the panels, choosing themes and identifying individuals that **match with our project's mission to highlight underrepresented stories of the American Revolution.**

Additionally, we are in need of stitchers! We are still looking for talented needleworkers from the following states:

- Rhode Island
- North & South Carolina
- New Hampshire

Think you may know the perfect person or organization? Send along our info! We'd love to hear from them.

I will be speaking at the Embroidery Guild of America [Mid-Atlantic Fall Retreat](https://www.marega.org/events/region-events/camp-stitch-a-lot) on Saturday, September 21 in New York & the [Carolinas Fall Retreat](https://www.egacarolinas.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/flyer_rev4_8-25-24.pdf) on Saturday, October 26 in North Carolina. I hope to meet some of you in person!
